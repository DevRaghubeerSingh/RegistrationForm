𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗹𝗲: Registration Form

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Design a simple registration form and store the value in Firebase database using android.

Note:- Firebase API Keys Have been removed from lib/firebase_options.dart Github Code for security purposes. But the app is working and app code is also there.
